### Health Inequality in Israel

This research project analyzes the determinants of health inequality in Israel. It includes a macro-level descriptive analysis and international comparison, a literature review, an individual-level analysis and a locality-level analysis.

Main findings:
1. Life expectancy in Israel is relatively high and rising (not surprising, everybody knows that). 
2. Inequality in life expectancy is relatively low in Israel and decreased during the past decades (surprising, I am the first one who shows data about inequality in life expectancy).
3. The main factors that determine health are socioeconomic factors, such as income, education and ethnic group, and not geographic factors (it was a surprise to people in the Ministry of Health and many others, that think that the main problem is the level of health services in the peripheral regions of Israel, and not things harder to control like behavioral factors). 

You can download the latest version of the full paper <a href= "https://orikatz.files.wordpress.com/2020/01/health-inequality.pdf">here</a>.

This library includes the followings:
1. Data folder - all relevant public data files. Some of the data files used in this project are not publicly available, see details in the Readme file inside the data folder.
2. Health inequality - A Python notebook that includes all the charts, maps and tree-charts of the paper. 
3. Do files folder - do-files (scripts of STATA) that incluedes all the regressions. 

What can you do with the materials of this project library, besides reproducing my resluts?
1. Draw maps of Israel according to different dimensions. The data folder includes shape files and you can see the relevant Python code in the notebook.
2. Calculate life expectancy gini coefficients for other countries / time periods.
3. Use the code for other health-related projects, for example to find out who are the Israelis who do not vaccinate their children (see basic analysis in one of the tree charts), or what are the causes of cancer level in different localities (probably something not related to my main variables). You can also use variables I didn't use, like different types of cancer.

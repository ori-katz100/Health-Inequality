### Health Inequality in Israel

This research project aimed to analyze the determinants of health inequality patterns in Israel. It includes a macro-level descriptive analysis and international comparison, a literature review, an individual-level analysis and a locality-level analysis.
Main findings:
1. Life expectancy in Israel is relatively high and rising (not surprising, everybody knows that). 
2. Inequality in life expectancy is relatively low in Israel and decreased during the past decades (surprising, I am the first one who shows data about this).
3. The main factors that determine health are socioeconomic factors, such as income, education and ethnic group, and not geographic factors (not surprising for me, but it was a suprise to people in the health department and many others that think that the main problem is health services in the peripheral regions).
